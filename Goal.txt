1. identify channel
2. send signal whenever we come close to breaking the channel (+-5%) and study the price afterwards to see returns.


Generalization of finding channels/automated process:
- Finding that 'middle line' with least square technique first generally over long spans of data --> would need to scan over the data and fit channels to it.
- Would require threshold of minimum 'touches' somehow. (First you draw the middle line, then you draw the upper/lower bounds, and then if there are proper touch areas, and more than like 2-3 for each bound, then you have a channel, and it would then draw it.).
- Use bulk data, not just Kraken 500 candles, maybe BTC hourly 56,000 candles. So you can get multiple potential channels to use.
- Would need to figure out how to chop data 

Defining a 'touch area' generally: 
- some % of ATR
- Some kind of moving Averages

Defining a 'breakout':
- Would need to be some % beyond the upper/lower bound.


Small shit:
- touch areas defined not only by 'high' and 'lows' but also 'opens' 'closing' maybe some kind of average of them. (Perhaps calculate wicks too!).
- Making sure the clumps of candles around a touch point, only the first one on the left is used
- Make sure there is 'wiggle' room for above and below the upper/lower trendlines.
- ML analysis on upper/lower bound returns after touch area.
- ML analaysis to identify channels within bulk data.
- Distance needs to be thought about (0.005 seems bad for all)
