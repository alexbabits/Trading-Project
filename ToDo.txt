To-Do:
0. Continue building things useful to improving trading results. General cleanup & condensing of code/functions where possible.
1. Modify functions to handle multiple coin pair df's. Download the next top 20 coins too.

Techniques/How to optimize:
1. Use ML to determine best mixture of stats to base trades on. "ex: if volume on last candle > avg(volume) of the line, the PNL is slightly better"
2. Need info about the surrounding candles. Can do ML binary classification for W/L trade, or do it by raw net_pl, +-$, Would want to figure out which features correlate to winning trades, and which features correlate to the best/highest winning trades.
3. Right now everything assumes an optimal entry. Find Optimal TP/SL levels. Optimal trailing SL level. 
4. Figure out an optimal entry somewhere on the horizontal resistance line, other than the 3rd touchpoint 

Misc Things:
- ML to determine a single trades expected PNL (input the features) (After you've trained a model on your existing data).
- SL probs best if small?
- Continue building the infrastructure for finding a good trading strategy with horizontal lines.
- Build some infrastructure to examine how features interact with the PNL.
- If returns tend to generally see maximum 'peak' after only 20-50 candles or something, then adjust TP/SL/trailing strategy accordingly. (Ex: if get to 50th candle, just exit position always, unless xyz reason to continue).
