To-do:
- Get bulk data to collect 1,000+ trades with associated PNL. Run this on top 25 cryptos or spread between cryptos.
- Look at returns and use statistics/correlations to find a good strategy.
- Multiple TP's and maybe SL's. X% out at each level. Find optimal amount and number. Trailing stop loss if that makes sense. Find optimal amount and number.
- Add trading fees (0.05%) per execution. (he said 20bps)

After the trades and returns are calculated:
- random samples for backtesting (if 30000 trades, randomly pull x amount, different samples, different coins, mix and match, different times, rigorous)
- should end up with a bellcurve of trade PNL's to look at, hopefully where mean is above zero and std is good as well.
- Extra stats to try to get better PNL and more +EV trades, narrowing down to best trades only. Try find spearman/pearson correlation between stats and PNL.
"ex: if volume on last candle > avg(volume) of the line, the PNL is slightly better".
- Useful stats: volume, distance from MA's, number of taps on line (no peak ahead), etc.
- Other stats: risk/reward ratio's and win % to breakeven.
- Plotly with bulk data, plot in chunks.
