Goal: 
- Identify horizontal support/resistance lines.
- Define an entry. Define a SL. Define TP levels. Do for all top 25 cryptos. Get ~5000 rows of data with statistics: returns, distance from MA's, atr, volume, number of taps on line, etc. Try to see if we can fit some pattern in positive returns with the data. Backtest to optimize SL/TP/etc.

To-do Current:
- functions are doing too much. (Return things that need to be returned, and then create smaller functions to deal with them (find max touch points, etc.))
- Get bulk data, do multiple coins (maybe 5-10k+ rows of data, and get like 10-20 coins), so u can get lots of return lines.
- Make better comments.

Next:
- Make horizontal support lines. (tbh dont think is strictly necessary for tinkering purposes, is v similar to horizontal resistance lines.)
- Make Channels (Harder version of this same task of horizontal lines.)
