To-do before Optimization:
1. Multiple TP's and/or SL's. Find optimal amount and number. Trailing stop loss too if optimal.
2. Need list of coin pairs to loop through as separate df's for functions/plots (df and resistance_df). (Basically will be a dictionary)

- Make sure no peak ahead (don't know all the number of touchpoints in advance for example, only know up to the live candle)

Stats useful for optimization:
- binance num trades during candle
- Distance from MA
- RSI
- volume (avg volume from initial point to entry, then track the volume afterwards, similar to how returns are tracked.)
- line length

How to optimize:
1. Yes
2. ???
3. Profit

Techniques:
- pull random samples for backtesting. Pull like 0.5-5% of total trades randomly 10,000 times to get bell curve of results.
- Look at returns and use spearman (non-linear) and/or pearson (linear) correlation between features in df and PNL. Use ML to determine best mixture of stats to base trades on.
- "ex: if volume on last candle > avg(volume) of the line, the PNL is slightly better"
