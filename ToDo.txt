To-do Current:
1. Get bulk data + multiple coins so can get bulk returns data to analyze for optimal strategy. (maybe 5-10k+ rows of data for each coin for 10-20 coins). Include distance from MA's, number of taps on line, volume, etc. to incorporate with optimization based on returns.

Next:
- Make Channels. Basically non-zero slope concept of horizontal resistance and support lines, with the added problem that both 'resistance' and 'support' channel bounds need to have similar/same slope in order for the channel to exist. So channels are quite rare.
