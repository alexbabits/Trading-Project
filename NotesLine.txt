Goal: 
- Identify horizontal support/resistance lines.
- Define an entry. Define a SL. Define TP levels. Do for all top 25 cryptos. Get ~5000 rows of data with statistics: returns, distance from MA's, atr, volume, number of taps on line, etc. Try to see if we can fit some pattern in positive returns with the data. Backtest to optimize SL/TP/etc.

To-do:
- Do same for horizontal support lines.

Tweaks:

- Exhaust the touchpoints (don't just identify the 2nd/3rd, try to identify them all, and then base trade on #3 or #4.)

- Have column for 'Total Number of Touch Points'

- Add statistics before/during trade (during line, and after line): (volume, distance from MA, etc.)

- Variable number of candles as 'rest period' rather than just 10.

- Include wicks (high/low) in some capacity (50% of their length, some % weight, include in touch points, include in bounds and limits).

- next_candle's ATR instead of current_candle's ATR.



- first green candle/point: Measure y-intercept between the high and the close instead of just the close, maybe a weighted avg (0.75*close + 0.25*high), or something like (HLC/3)

- Minimum volatility for line to exist, (minimum bounce away from the line after a touchpoint?) Ehhh

- Line exists until it breaks, rather than currently ending if we hit 5*ATR?
