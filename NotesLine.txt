Goal: 
- Identify horizontal support/resistance lines.
- Define an entry. Define a SL. Define TP levels. Do for all top 25 cryptos. Get ~5000 rows of data with statistics: returns, distance from MA's, atr, volume, number of taps on line, etc. Try to see if we can fit some pattern in positive returns with the data. Backtest to optimize SL/TP/etc.

To-do:
- Define SL, TP levels during trade.
- Make horizontal support lines.
- Do all cleanup before modifying core code function.

Tweaks:

- Generally polish code see if functions can be split up to be more readable, comment better, etc.
