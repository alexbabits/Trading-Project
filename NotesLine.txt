Goal: 
- Identify horizontal support/resistance lines.
- Define an entry. Define a SL. Define TP levels. Do for all top 25 cryptos. Get ~5000 rows of data with statistics: returns, distance from MA's, atr, volume, number of taps on line, etc. Try to see if we can fit some pattern in positive returns with the data. Backtest to optimize SL/TP/etc.

To-do:
- Define SL, TP levels during trade.
- Make horizontal support lines.
- Do all cleanup before modifying core code function.

Tweaks:

- start/end/touchpoints/ranges/limits: Rather than close, do mean(high,close), or weighted_mean(0.75*close + 0.25*high), or something like (HLC/3).
- (For bottom_limit would be focusing on the 'low' rather than 'high' since it's looking for target below the resistance line.)

- Maybe remove the condition for the line termination if price goes far enough below the line? (5*ATR). A potential problem with this is, code is setup so there is no overlap, so if all time high line just continues for a long time, then it may not draw other lines.

- Identify all touchpoints, not just up to 3. Base trade of #3 or #4. (Have column for 'Total Number of Touch Points'). Requires re-working 'find_third_touch' function.

- Generally polish code see if functions can be split up to be more readable, comment better, etc.
