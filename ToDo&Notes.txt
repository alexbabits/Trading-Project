To-Do:
1. Modify functions to handle multiple coin pair df's. Download the next top 20 coins too (2017 to present)
2. Multiple TP/SL and trailing losses.
3. Include smth like 'rsi>50' or 'above vwap' for more strict trade entry requirements.

Techniques/How to optimize:
1. Determine best mixture of stats and things to base trades on. "ex: if volume on last candle > avg(volume) of the line, the PNL is slightly better"
2. Right now everything assumes an optimal entry. Find Optimal TP/SL levels. Optimal trailing SL level. 
3. Figure out an optimal entry somewhere on the horizontal resistance line, other than the 3rd touchpoint 

Misc Things:
- Build some infrastructure to examine how features interact with the PNL.
- Adjust TP/SL/trailing strategy according to 'returns from entry' data. (Always exit after 50 candles if still in trade or whatever.)
- Good Analysis tools: https://pypi.org/project/QuantStats/ "(benchmark can be a pandas Series or ticker) qs.reports.html(stock, "SPY")"
- We want low drawdowns and good returns/low volatility/consistent: min(max_drawdown)
- Trades on lower timeframe (entry on 5 min) but looks at 15m/30m/1hr/daily also, just how professionals do.
- Always think outside the box.

Returns analysis:
--> e0 to e1 is, if majority turn negative, then perhaps that entry isn't the best. Can tweak entries.
--> Could sum all returns over 100,200 etc. candles to see how the strategy does.
--> If currently exiting far before general peaks of returns then can tweak exits

Notes:
- Think of more ways to improve trading strategy for horizontal lines
- More stats outputs like from backtesting.py and QuantStats.
- Make it so you can just pip install your trading package and then do 'backtesting(price_and_indicators_df,trades_df)' Where it gives you all the results.


Channel thoughts:
--> Non-zero slope concept of horizontal resistance and support lines. Bottom slope is support line, top slope is resistance line. With the added problem that both lines need to have similar/same slope in order for the channel to exist. So channels are quite rare. Based on least squares for the middle/top/bottom lines.
--> What constitutes a touch point/area? Can make this hyper complex with weights and all sorts of clever thresholds (weighting wicks, volatility and ATR, clumping amount, time between touches, etc.)
--> Would you generate the top line/bottom line or the middle line first and just use that slope? Minimum threshold to generate a channel.
--> Trade entry location
