To-Do:
1. Multiple TP, single SL below entry, and trailing losses which match the previous.
2. Handle multiple coin pairs. ETH and BTC is perfect for testing right now.
3. Download the next top 20 coins too (2017 to present).
4. Actually make a good strategy. (Find Optimal TP/SL levels. Optimal trailing SL level. Optimal Entry.)

Misc Things:
- Build more infrastructure to examine how features interact with the PNL.
- Adjust TP/SL/trailing strategy according to 'returns from entry' data. (Always exit after 50 candles if still in trade or whatever.)
- Good Analysis tools: https://pypi.org/project/QuantStats/ "(benchmark can be a pandas Series or ticker) qs.reports.html(stock, "SPY")"
- GOAL: Low drawdowns, Low Volatility, High returns. min(max_drawdown), min(max_volatility), max(returns)
- Trades on lower timeframe (entry on 5 min) but looks at 15m/30m/1hr/daily also, just how professionals do.
- Always think outside the box.

Notes:
- Think of more ways to improve trading strategy for horizontal lines
- ex: if volume on last candle > avg(volume) of the line, the PNL is slightly better
- More stats outputs like from backtesting.py and QuantStats.
- Make it so you can just pip install your trading package and then do 'backtesting(price_and_indicators_df,trades_df)' Where it gives you all the results.


Channel thoughts:
--> Non-zero slope concept of horizontal resistance and support lines. Bottom slope is support line, top slope is resistance line. With the added problem that both lines need to have similar/same slope in order for the channel to exist. So channels are quite rare. Based on least squares for the middle/top/bottom lines.
--> What constitutes a touch point/area? Can make this hyper complex with weights and all sorts of clever thresholds (weighting wicks, volatility and ATR, clumping amount, time between touches, etc.)
--> Would you generate the top line/bottom line or the middle line first and just use that slope? Minimum threshold to generate a channel.
--> Trade entry location


Stats to include from backtesting.py and quantstats:
(Most/all of these are vs benchmark too)
-Exposure time
-max drawdown
-avg drawdown 
-sharpe ratio
-sortino ratio
-equity peak
-equity final
-returns (annual)
-Volatility %
-Best trade % gain
-worst trade % gain
-avg trade % gain
-PNL cumulative portfolio value/cumulative return vs SP500
-PNL cumulative portfolio value/cumulative return vs SP500 (Volatility matched)
-Yearly/Monthly/Daily (Will look like brownian motion/noise mostly). (Yearly vs benchmark)
-Avg up month %, Avg down month %, win days %, win month %, win year % 
-Best Day/Month/Year %, Worst Day/Month/Year % 
-Kelly Critierion % 
-Daily/Monthly/Yearly EV %
-Expected Shortfall (cVaR) %
-Underwater plot (shows drawdowns only 0% is the highest baseline, is line/area chart with drawdowns)
-Worst 10 Drawdowns (start, end, drawdown %, days)



Enter the trade with a full position size of $10k.
Set the main stop loss (SL) level below the entry point.
Set three take profit (TP) levels above the entry point: TP1, TP2, and TP3.
If the price hits the main SL before any TP level, exit the entire position and the trade ends.
If the price hits TP1 before the main SL, exit 50% of the position. Now, we are looking for either TP2 or a trailing SL1 (which is at the entry level).
If the price hits trailing SL1 before TP2, exit the remaining position and the trade ends.
If the price hits TP2 before trailing SL1, exit 25% of the original position. Now, we are looking for either TP3 or a trailing SL2 (which is at the TP1 level).
If the price hits trailing SL2 before TP3, exit the remaining position and the trade ends.
If the price hits TP3 before trailing SL2, exit the remaining position and the trade ends.
