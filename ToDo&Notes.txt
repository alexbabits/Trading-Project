To-Do:
0. Handle multiple coin pairs. ETH and BTC is perfect for testing right now.
1. Clean up readme & Comments on what functions do. General cleanup of code. (Perhaps Strategy.ipynb, and an Analysis.ipynb)
2. Download the next top 20 coins too (2017 to present).
3. Actually make a good strategy. (Find Optimal TP/SL levels. Optimal trailing SL level. Optimal Entry.)
4. Eventually make streamlined process for any strategy. (Data --> Any Trade Strategy --> Results and Analysis). (would be pretty complex to package it nicely.)
5. Determine if 'multiple tp/sl hit within same candle' is even an issue. Can already enter and exit within same candle, and I think sl's are prioritized over tp's, so if a trailing stop loss and tp hit in same candle, maybe both are hit, or just says the trailing stop loss is.

Tips:
- Use 'returns from entry' to get ideas for good Entries/TP levels/SL levels/hold time.
- GOAL: Low drawdowns, Low Volatility, High returns. min(max_drawdown), min(max_volatility), max(returns)
- Trades on lower timeframe (entry on 5 min) but looks at 15m/30m/1hr/daily also, just how professionals do.
- ex: if volume on last candle > avg(volume) of the line, the PNL is slightly better


Channel thoughts:
--> Non-zero slope concept of horizontal resistance and support lines. Bottom slope is support line, top slope is resistance line. With the added problem that both lines need to have similar/same slope in order for the channel to exist. So channels are quite rare. Based on least squares for the middle/top/bottom lines.
--> What constitutes a touch point/area? Can make this hyper complex with weights and all sorts of clever thresholds (weighting wicks, volatility and ATR, clumping amount, time between touches, etc.)
--> Would you generate the top line/bottom line or the middle line first and just use that slope? Minimum threshold to generate a channel.
--> Trade entry location
