To-Do:
1. More stats outputs like from backtesting.py and QuantStats.
2. Handle multiple coin pairs. ETH and BTC is perfect for testing right now.
3. Clean up readme & Comments on what functions do.
4. Download the next top 20 coins too (2017 to present).
5. Actually make a good strategy. (Find Optimal TP/SL levels. Optimal trailing SL level. Optimal Entry.)
6. Eventually make streamlined process for any strategy. (Data --> Any Trade Strategy --> Results and Analysis). (would be pretty complex to package it nicely.)

Tips:

- Use 'returns from entry' to get ideas for good Entries/TP levels/SL levels/hold time.
- GOAL: Low drawdowns, Low Volatility, High returns. min(max_drawdown), min(max_volatility), max(returns)
- Trades on lower timeframe (entry on 5 min) but looks at 15m/30m/1hr/daily also, just how professionals do.
- ex: if volume on last candle > avg(volume) of the line, the PNL is slightly better

Stats to include from backtesting.py and quantstats (https://pypi.org/project/QuantStats/) (Most/all of these are vs benchmark too):
-Longest drawdown time
-Worst 3 Drawdowns (start, end, drawdown %, days)
-Best trade % gain, worst trade % gain, avg trade % gain
-6 month rolling sharpe, sortino, volatility, and their average (horizontal line on the graph)
-SP500 hodl PNL (graph vs our cumulative pnl) (And another plot for (Volatility matched))
-Yearly/Monthly/Daily % returns (Will look like brownian motion/noise mostly). (Yearly vs benchmark) (graph daily, seems to be bar chart?)
-Avg up month %, Avg down month %, win days %, win month %, win year % 
-Best Day/Month/Year %, Worst Day/Month/Year % 
-Kelly Critierion % 
-Daily/Monthly/Yearly EV/expected return %. (Perhaps from that random sampling, will be a probability.)
-Expected Shortfall (cVaR) %


Channel thoughts:
--> Non-zero slope concept of horizontal resistance and support lines. Bottom slope is support line, top slope is resistance line. With the added problem that both lines need to have similar/same slope in order for the channel to exist. So channels are quite rare. Based on least squares for the middle/top/bottom lines.
--> What constitutes a touch point/area? Can make this hyper complex with weights and all sorts of clever thresholds (weighting wicks, volatility and ATR, clumping amount, time between touches, etc.)
--> Would you generate the top line/bottom line or the middle line first and just use that slope? Minimum threshold to generate a channel.
--> Trade entry location
