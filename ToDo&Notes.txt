To-Do:
0. 'within the same candle' problem with multiple levels hit (tps or tp and a sl, etc.)
1. Make nice global variables for inputs (candle interval, pos_size, things like that).
2. More stats outputs like from backtesting.py and QuantStats.
3. Make it so you can just pip install your trading package and then do 'backtesting(price_and_indicators_df,trades_df)' Where it gives you all the results.
4. Clean up readme
5. Handle multiple coin pairs. ETH and BTC is perfect for testing right now.
6. Download the next top 20 coins too (2017 to present).
7. Actually make a good strategy. (Find Optimal TP/SL levels. Optimal trailing SL level. Optimal Entry.)
8. Build more infrastructure to examine how features interact with the PNL.

Tips:

- Use 'returns from entry' to get an idea for optimal Entry/TP/SL.
- GOAL: Low drawdowns, Low Volatility, High returns. min(max_drawdown), min(max_volatility), max(returns)
- Trades on lower timeframe (entry on 5 min) but looks at 15m/30m/1hr/daily also, just how professionals do.
- ex: if volume on last candle > avg(volume) of the line, the PNL is slightly better

Stats to include from backtesting.py and quantstats (https://pypi.org/project/QuantStats/):
(Most/all of these are vs benchmark too)
-Exposure time
-max drawdown
-avg drawdown 
-sharpe ratio
-sortino ratio
-equity peak
-equity final
-returns (annual)
-Volatility %
-Best trade % gain
-worst trade % gain
-avg trade % gain
-PNL cumulative portfolio value/cumulative return vs SP500
-PNL cumulative portfolio value/cumulative return vs SP500 (Volatility matched)
-Yearly/Monthly/Daily (Will look like brownian motion/noise mostly). (Yearly vs benchmark)
-Avg up month %, Avg down month %, win days %, win month %, win year % 
-Best Day/Month/Year %, Worst Day/Month/Year % 
-Kelly Critierion % 
-Daily/Monthly/Yearly EV %
-Expected Shortfall (cVaR) %
-Underwater plot (shows drawdowns only 0% is the highest baseline, is line/area chart with drawdowns)
-Worst 10 Drawdowns (start, end, drawdown %, days)



Channel thoughts:
--> Non-zero slope concept of horizontal resistance and support lines. Bottom slope is support line, top slope is resistance line. With the added problem that both lines need to have similar/same slope in order for the channel to exist. So channels are quite rare. Based on least squares for the middle/top/bottom lines.
--> What constitutes a touch point/area? Can make this hyper complex with weights and all sorts of clever thresholds (weighting wicks, volatility and ATR, clumping amount, time between touches, etc.)
--> Would you generate the top line/bottom line or the middle line first and just use that slope? Minimum threshold to generate a channel.
--> Trade entry location
